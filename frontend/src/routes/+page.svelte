                For years, the Great Institute has functioned in fragmented
                silence. Knowledge is scattered across unofficial drives,
                grievances vanish into administrative voids, and students wander
                lost between hostel blocks and academic buildings. Scholars pool
                their resources for transport in secret WhatsApp groups,
                research opportunities reach only the chosen few, and lost
                belongings drift unclaimed in the shadows of campus corners.
